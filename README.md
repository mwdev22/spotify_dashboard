Project created with Flask and Spotify API to show data about users, their stats, current trends and user playlist. 
In this project im using Spotify OAuth2. 
Project is a bit similar to popular website https://www.statsforspotify.com.
I left .env file outside the .gitignore for recruiters, if somebody wants to test how my application works.
